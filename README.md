## 🧮 Problem 1 – Calculator
A simple calculator performing:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

Inputs:
- `a`: double  
- `b`: double  
- `operation`: string  

The program includes checks for invalid operations and division by zero.

## 🔢 Problem 2 – Odd Number Series  
Given an input `a`, generate a series of odd numbers:

Examples:
- a = 1 → 1  
- a = 2 → 1, 3  
- a = 3 → 1, 3, 5  

---

## 🔁 Problem 3 – Conditional Odd Series  
Rules:
- If `a` is **odd**, generate odd numbers up to **a**
- If `a` is **even**, generate odd numbers up to **a - 1**

Examples:
- a = 2 → 1  
- a = 3 → 1, 3, 5  
- a = 6 → 1, 3, 5

## 📊 Problem 4 – Multiples Counter  
Given a list of numbers, count how many values are multiples of each digit **1 through 9**.

Example output:

{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
